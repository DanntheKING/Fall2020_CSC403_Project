1. I added the retreat button to the battle screen. When clicked, it updates the current health bars of both characters and closes the battle window if both players are still alive.
2. I added the counter button to the battke screen. When clicked it subtracts (-1) health from both player and enemy.
3. I added the finisher button to the battle screen. If the enemy's health is beneath 10 and the player has more health than the enemy, then clciking the button subtracts (-6) health points from enemy. 
4. I created another public variable to the enemy class called 'Boss,' with public get and set, to assign a specific enemy as the boss of the level.
5. I added a conditional statement to the 'GetInstance()' function that increases the enemies max health and health to 60, instead of the normal 20.
